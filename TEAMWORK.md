## _Milestone 1_

### *Division of Labour*: 
**Grace will be working on the troubleshooting file, and Marco is doing the readme file and I'll be doing the teamwork contract.** Everyone will need to do their individual's github issue and pull request.

### *Timing*: 
Everyone should aim to have their part finished by our Thursday's meeting. If someone is experiencing some difficulties we can always discuss them during our Thursday's meeting and sort it out. The goal is to have the milestone finished and submitted on Thursday. 

### *Communication*: 
* We will communicate through Slack for everything.
* Ideally everyone should respond to a message within 24 hours.
* We will try to meeting during classes and one final meeting on Thursday to finish the milestone 1 before Friday's deadline. 

### *Contingency plan*
1. If milestone 1 is not finished by Thursday, we will plan another meeting on Friday, possibly via zoom, to finish it before 5pm.
2. If a team member is unable to finish his/her part by Friday and the deadline is within 1 hour, the rest of the team will be doing his/her part.
